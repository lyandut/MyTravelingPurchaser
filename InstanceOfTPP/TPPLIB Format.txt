Reading a TPPLIB file
A TPPLIB File is exacty a TSPLIB file + two more sections

DEMAND_SECTION:

The number of products and the demand is specified in this section. An integer gives the number of products in the first line. Then, for each product, demand has to be given by mean the product's id followed by the demanded amount for this product.

The first line is of the form 
<integer> 
And each of the following lines is of the form 
<integer> <integer> 
 

OFFER_SECTION:

The offer of all markets are specified in the form (per line)

<integer> <integer> [<integer> <integer> <integer>] ...

where the first integer gives the market's id, the following integer the number of products offered by that market and as many triplets as the second integer.  Each integer of the triplet gives the product's id, product's cost and product's availability respectively. In the classical TPP particular instance the availability amount is 1.

Notice that the market with label "1" is always the depot, so no amount is offerted in this market.
